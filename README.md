# shopping-cart-project

This is a mini shopping cart project that displays a gallery of products using bootstrap cards. A user creates an account and then adds the products to his/her shopping cart. The cart has a user session to differenciate different users and their cart items. The user can delete individual cart items based on his/her session ID. Upon adding an item to the cart, the items are displayed using SQL joins from the cart, users and products table to show individual cart session. 
The bootstrap version used is 5.3 and the database connection is facilitated by PDO.
