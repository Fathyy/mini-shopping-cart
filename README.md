# shopping-cart-project

This is a mini shopping cart project that displays a gallery of products using bootstrap cards. The product card can be viewed individually based on the product id stored in the database. After a product is selected, it is redirected to a display page that shows the image and details side by side. 
The user views the product details and then proceeds to add them to the cart. 
The bootstrap version used is 5.3 and the database connection is facilitated by PDO.
